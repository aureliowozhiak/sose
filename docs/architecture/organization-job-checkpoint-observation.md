# #496 W3b — admitted organizational job checkpoint observation

Dependency: **#540 W3a** owner-qualified StateChart event observation.
This is a separate read-side increment, not executable composition.

`observe_organization_jobs` first validates the exact
`OrganizationDefinition` against real catalog, process manifests and consumer
registrations. It reads one authoritative `Persistence.job_states()` tuple and
projects checkpoints only for exactly declared job IDs and matching component
domains. A declared job without a persisted `SimulationJobState` remains
`checkpoint_present=False` with absent runtime fields.

A *declared owner* is carried as topology configuration only. The persisted
`SimulationJobState` does **not** attest immutable owner identity, so this
projection does not claim durable per-component ownership or organizational
authorization. It cannot attest that a boundary ACK, downstream Command, effect,
or physically reserved interval actually occurred. The persisted job status
and trigger IDs are observations, **not execution certificates**.

Tests cover Memory and SQLite/restart, missing checkpoints, unrelated jobs,
wrong component domain, duplicate observed identity, immutable inputs and a
single snapshot read. No global clock, lock, coordination or cross-owner cut is
invented. A combined entity/event/queue/job/resource snapshot with consistent
owner-qualified causal certificates is future #496 work, not this increment.
The heterogeneous #497 and prospective OD-5a #461 gates remain closed.
